.@TomiLahren on Democrats' strategies in 2018 midterm elections: "It's going to be really hard to win an election in 2018 or 2020 when the only thing that [Democrats] have...is identity politics & resistance. Meanwhile, @POTUS is winning for all Americans."

It was just reported on TRMS that there appears to be a connection between Russian interference and down-ticket elections which were overseen by none other than Paul Ryan who may have helped disseminate material hacked by Russia. How many Repubs does Putin own, anyway?

The GOP is celebrating passing the #GOPTaxScam, they aren't done. They'll starting bemoaning the 1.5 trillion in national debt they created. In the New Year they'll care so much about that deficit they'll try cutting your entitlement programs: #Medicare #SocialSecurity #Medicaid

Trump is the most unhinged, pathetic, corrupt, lazy, insufferable, sluggish, pitiful, heartless, deplorable, miserable, sad, dismal, uninspiring, mentally unbalanced, demented, unglued, obnoxious, disturbed, insane, delirious and crazy president in the history of this country.

"Trump represents Normal Americans, the ones the elites on both the right & left look down upon with contempt, and fear.
They don‚Äôt really hate Donald Trump
They hate who he represents
They hate us and they hate that they can‚Äôt do a damn thing about it."

GOP Rep Ron DeSantis lied yesterday on FoxNews saying Clinton hired British spy Steele to trick the FBI into investigating Trump-Russia ties using the Dossier. Just so happens DeSantis got over $40,000 from Trump‚Äôs biggest donors in 2016. Coincidence? Nope. He was bought off.

Today was Trump‚Äôs 111th day spent at one of his properties since taking office. At the end of this vacation he will have spent over $120 million in taxpayer money on these trips. He should pay it all back & then resign in disgrace. Most corrupt president in US history. By far.

The Dossier wasn‚Äôt the basis for the Trump-Russia probes. Over 20 Trump team members had dozens of contacts with Russians linked to Putin before & after the election. Russia interfered in our elections to benefit Trump. Do the math. Trump is a traitor, the GOP needs to wake up.

Whatever you do, don‚Äôt retweet this analysis I did of the Trump-Russia Dossier. It will ruin Trump‚Äôs day & make him absolutely furious.

On second thought, retweet the F out of it. The Dossier & Christopher Steele are more credible than Trump‚Äôll ever be.

At the end of Trump‚Äôs vacation he will have spent $120 million in taxpayer money on his travels. And since he‚Äôs staying at his own resorts, he‚Äôs actually making money off of those tax dollars. Most corrupt president ever.
