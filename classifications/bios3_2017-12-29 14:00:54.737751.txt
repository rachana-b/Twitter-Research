Ok all-part 1 of our Follow The Money investigation will be released within the next hour. This should help push back against the attacks on Mueller. It will at the very least be a good start. Story got bigger-needed more research-hence the delay. @GrantStern with the exclusive.

Why is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!

This carried interest loophole is a microcosm of what is wrong with D.C.: a system rigged by a Ruling Class and its cronies to benefit themselves, not the American people. @trish_regan is right: close the loophole.

Christopher Steele believes his dossier on Trump-Russia is 70-90% accurate-says his FBI contacts greeted his intel report with ‚Äòshock & horror.' Also, keep in mind some of the Dossier's already been verified as true. Anyone saying it's all false is lying.

Duffy‚Äôs a dud. With a Dem President he sponsored legislation to pay down the deficit. Under Trump and the new tax bill, he‚Äôs voted to increase the deficit by 1.5 trillion$. Appearing on Fox, like all the other Repubs who haven‚Äôt done squat, trying to get free campaign publicity.
