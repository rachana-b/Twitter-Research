So I've been thinking about how to post my #CommitToFlip statement for a couple days now

Saw a lot of good one's out there about the importance of taking Congress back, electing quality candidates, dedicating more time & new ways to accomplish the #BlueWave in 2018

In this film, the main character "Tiger Chen" was enlightened, centered & very well skilled. But then the dark side came calling.

In my opinion, whoever wrote this movie combined the spirit of old school Star Wars & Kung Fu movies together brilliantly.

It's easy to be angered by today's politics. But it's not so easy to be most effective & beneficial to the path of progress while enraged.

Anger consumes a lot of energy, and can taint one's soul over time.

We must remain calm to resist on.

It is a very difficult thing to do

Apparently there are going to be trees planted in the location CNN snuck through the bushes to see Trump golf. 

And of course that upsets them.

Only Trump could make a party of radical Earthers oppose the planting of trees.

It's the constant and determined effort that breaks down all resistance, sweeps away all obstacles.

To win you've got to stay in the game.
Every person is the creation of himself, the image of his own thinking and believing. As individuals think & believe, so they are.

Dear Hillary Clinton: I made Huma Abedin's emails available online yesterday for all the world to search. I used my own time, my own resources, and my own money--something you've never done.

.@JessicaTarlov, business of truth?  The #MSM has been about fake news this entire year.  Either they make it up or don’t report it.  Their fans never get the true news, only what the #MSM wants them to know.  @POTUS is spot on correct.  You are avoiding the truth.  #FakeNews

Why would smart voters want to put Democrats in Congress in 2018 Election when their policies will totally kill the great wealth created during the months since the Election. People are much better off now not to mention ISIS, VA, Judges, Strong Border, 2nd A, Tax Cuts & more?

Seriously, @twitter?...@jack?

Sheriff Clark is threatening the lives of journalists on twitter..and intimidating others off twitter as well. The FBI had to get involved? 

Don’t you think it’s time to delete his account?

I'm walking into 2018 with clear heart & mind. If you wronged me, all good - lesson learned. If you're angry with me, you've won - I let go. If you feel I've wronged you, I apologize.
Forgiving someone is for you not the other person...don't block your BLESSING.
