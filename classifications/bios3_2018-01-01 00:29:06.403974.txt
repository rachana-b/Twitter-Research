My friends,

I sincerely believe that 2018 will be a year of victories. I believe we will win many hard fought battles and will make more progress on other ones than any year in recent memory.

I love and appreciate you. I believe in us.

Happy New Year!

-Shaun

Gov: I gave Sarah pecans from our orchard for Christmas. Are we sure she shot them out of a tree??? See here https://twitter.com/presssec/status/941132980499644416 …  #piegate2

For family dinner I made smoked prime rib and black eye peas and @PressSec made “America Pie” from pecans she shot out of the tree.  Pie is gone but enough peas for New Year Day. It’s a Southern thing!

REMINDER: Social Security & Medicare don't add a single penny to the deficit. They are fully funded through separate taxes. Anyone who claims these programs need to be cut in order to fix the budget deficit IS LYING TO YOU. #SaveSocialSecurity #SaveMedicare

1.  Official history is merely a veil to hide the truth of what really happened. When the veil is lifted, again and again we see that not only is the official version not true, it is often 100% wrong.

62. In 1880, Charles Taze Russell, this friend of the #Rothschilds, predicted that the Jews would return to their homeland. It was about the only prediction Russell ever got right. Why? Because he knew the plan. #TheStormIsHere #Q #QAnon #Merkel #Hitler
