I wish you all well in 2018... seems we have something in common. I suppose the only difference between us is we have a leader willing to lead us to prosperity with the rule of law. We still have a long road ahead and will likely go longer than President Trump is in office (8yrs)

Ray Sultz Retweeted Donald J. Trump
About time we stop feeding the wolves that bite us at every opportunity.  Way to go President Trump, you are a real Patriot leader. Now build the wall with the savings on all our hush money and give seniors strugling on SS a raise. Love you and Melina.

The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools. They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!

Does this mean the UN was ever functioning as anything other than a waste, fraud, and abuse organization? Did we not just cut their allowance for less of the same? Nothing goes on at the UN except providing an office for world leaders to meet and do nothing...

RT: Here’s the first video I want to make viral in 2018. Let’s do it. Happy New Year!

It’s of Donald “no Russian ties” Trump doing business in Russia, next to an oligarch, talking about building Trump Tower Moscow & all his Russian business meetings.

I don’t appreciate being lied to @SpeakerRyan. Especially when it has to do with national security. You told the American public that Devin Nunes recused himself from the Russia probe & instead, he’s issuing subpoenas & canceling hearings. #RemoveNunes from the Intel Cmte NOW!

Blood on Obama’s Hands.
        
In 2009 tens of thousands of brave Iranian democracy protesters rose up against a brutal Khamenei regime after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was announced the winner in a disputed national election.
