Finally!!! A 25 year respected CIA veteran states that his assessment is that Mobster Trump works directly for the Russians.. I hope more reputable voices drop all the political correctness and speak the truth. Trump is the biggest threat to our National Security

The @GOP will be held directly responsible for installing this danger into the WH. @SpeakerRyan in a leaked transcript said that @realDonaldTrump @RepRohrabacher are on Putin‚Äôs payroll. Then he laughed and said that it needs to be kept in the family. Last laugh will be on the GOP

The amount of that Trump helped launder and the people he worked with/for (Mogilevich) would leave the Kremlin more than enough blackmail

If people think @realDonaldTrump is going to get impeached, I think they‚Äôre wrong since three presidents managed to escape impeachment technically three times, so don‚Äôt hold your breath people. #DonaldTrump #ImpeachTrump

Ryan is in it up his tiny little testicles. His SuperPAC accepted millions from Russian "donors". He's also a Koch stooge. Bought and paid for.

It‚Äôs now clear @SpeakerRyan is helping GOP Rep Devin Nunes interfere in the Russia probes. Ryan kept Nunes on Intel Cmte even though he violated his recusal. Now Ryan‚Äôs letting Nunes attack FBI, DoJ & Mueller‚Äôs probe using Congressional powers. Paul Ryan should be investigated.

(17) I am confident that justice is coming, in one way or another. What an immensely positive contribution the USA has made to the world, thanks to the Founding Fathers, and everyone who has maintained the Republic all this time.

(18) I live in a privileged, ungrateful little country that, at best, ignores the suffering of oppressed people the world over. I guess, today that made me feel sad for a while. My challenge is to patiently await freedom in Iran and justice in America.

don‚Äôt ever turn down the opportunity to FEEL. feel things as deeply as they need to be felt. this is what you came here to do, to be a channel for emotions. any emotion is a blessing if you let it be, if you let go of resistance as well as attachment to it. you‚Äôre safe to feel
