Hank Rearden Retweeted Breitbart News
"It's a very delicate balancing act because while we try to make sure that they were protected from the cars and the other things that were going on, we also gave those who wished to destroy space to do that as well..."

Is it surprising lawlessness now includes murder?

The most delusional thing about Donald Trump is that he actually thinks that if he tweets about James Comey or Huma Abedin that it will exonerate himself in the Russia Investigation. Sorry Donald but when you commit a crime this BIG a few misinformed tweets won‚Äôt make it go away!

POTUS on 12/28: ‚ÄúI have the absolute right to do what I want with the Justice Department.‚Äù Today he slanders career DOJ professionals as ‚Äúdeep state,‚Äù calls for prison for a political opponent, and tries to sic DOJ on a potential witness against him. Beyond abnormal; dangerous.

Crooked Hillary Clinton‚Äôs top aid, Huma Abedin, has been accused of disregarding basic security protocols. She put Classified Passwords into the hands of foreign agents. Remember sailors pictures on submarine? Jail! Deep State Justice Dept must finally act? Also on Comey & others

Jobs, jobs, jobs!  NO!

People aren't in the streets screaming, "We need jobs, Trump".
They are in the streets begging for $12-$15 per hour (from their jobs), just to "Make It".

This new #taxscambill is written to magnifying the ongoing greed, and it will only get worse.

#GOPTaxScamBill does nothing to create jobs, just debt. Economic problem is not supply, it‚Äôs lack of demand to fuel growth. 140 million Americans aren‚Äôt lazy; 400 are greedy. When working full-time at minimum wage earns $250 week; problem is wages, not workers #TuesdayThoughts

Everyone who retweets this agrees that any Republican Member of Congress who interferes with Mueller‚Äôs probe should be thrown out of Congress, and thrown into prison. Here‚Äôs a perfect example:

Trump fired every single member of his HIV/AIDS council without telling them why. Not only that, he did it in a letter sent via FedEx. He didn't even pick up the phone & call them. Laziest & most cruel president in the history of the United States-and obviously a complete coward.

I don‚Äôt appreciate being lied to @SpeakerRyan. Especially when it has to do with national security. You told the American public that Devin Nunes recused himself from the Russia probe & instead, he‚Äôs issuing subpoenas & canceling hearings. #RemoveNunes from the Intel Cmte NOW!

Biggest news of the day is the fact the Republican National Committee is being investigated by Mueller for conspiring with Trump, his campaign & Russia against the United States in order to interfere in our elections & undermine our democracy. They‚Äôre gonna need a bigger prison.

Whatever you do, don‚Äôt retweet this analysis I did of the Trump-Russia Dossier. It will ruin Trump‚Äôs day & make him absolutely furious.

On second thought, retweet the F out of it. The Dossier & Christopher Steele are more credible than Trump‚Äôll ever be.

At the end of Trump‚Äôs vacation he will have spent $120 million in taxpayer money on his travels. And since he‚Äôs staying at his own resorts, he‚Äôs actually making money off of those tax dollars. Most corrupt president ever.
