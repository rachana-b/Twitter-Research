7. So Fusion Gps says no, it was NOT dossier that started FBI investigation, it was all those OTHER reports they received INDEPENDENTLY, that were CORROBORATED by the Steele dossier.

6. They say they told Senate Judiciary (so GRASSLEY) in Aug. '17 that reason why Steele dossier was taken so seriously was it corroborated reports FBI received from others,  "INCLUDING A SOURCE IN TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN". BIG news here.

5. It's time for us to DEMAND the release of those transcripts. Starting with @chuckgrassley who promised to release them. They HAVE been reviewed so there is NO excuse not to.

No sitting on sidelines folks in 2018. Either you are fighting for our democratic ideals & the safety & security of this & future generations or you're with the unhinged, unfit, low travelers who reject rule of law and basic norms of decency. #TwoChoices #TwoPaths

I am going to just start reporting good old @realDonaldTrump whenever he posts something that violates @Twitter's policies.  Why?  If we are accountable, so is he.

Given how often Trump's tweets foreshadow what's about to air on Fox News or tell folks to tune in, I wonder whether it's worth inquiring if he's actually partially directing what they cover rather than simply responding to their coverage.

Zionists want to destroy Ahed Tamimi not only because she embodies their deepest anxieties about Palestinian resistance, but also because she refuses to hide her contempt for the shitty little colony they adore.

Iran is cutting off internet access. Trump blocked people who were annoying him on twitter. They are not "barred from twitter." FAKE NEWS.

Y’all realize that while Trump is running around provoking an unstable dictator, Kim Jong-Un is still an unstable dictator. 

There will be no voice of reason on the other end when he’s had enough and decides to act. No govt, no people, no military. Zero resistance.

Liberals are triggered AGAIN just because President Trump said he would  defend America against communist dictator Kim Jong Un. Maybe if Trump gave nukes to North Korea like Bill Clinton did the left would be happy.
