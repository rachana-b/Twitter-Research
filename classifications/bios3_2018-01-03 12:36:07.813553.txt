#WednesdayWisdom We've gotten to a weird place where it really doesn't matter what liquor drinking, pot smoking #CNN gay reports anymore, because it's so bizarre, strange, and fake! They are the enemy of our country and friend of N Korea Iran and Antifa

President Trump was simply stating a FACT that his nuclear button is much more powerful. 

If anyone is offended by that then you know they are a liberal. 

Liberals are allergic to facts and truths.

15 minutes of snooze is great. 15 minutes to open an IRA is better. Open and fund a TD Ameritrade IRA and get up to $600.

Trump asked what we had to lose? We're getting a glimpse right now -- he'll only get more erratic and problematic as the investigation progresses and the world turns its back on us.

Actually, seeking assistance isn't necessarily illegal. In any case, he did not. 

If you have evidence to the contrary, send it to the FBI. 

Don't tell me about patriotism, junior. You've never lifted a finger to help this country.

The @GOP will be held directly responsible for installing this danger into the WH. @SpeakerRyan in a leaked transcript said that @realDonaldTrump @RepRohrabacher are on Putin‚Äôs payroll. Then he laughed and said that it needs to be kept in the family. Last laugh will be on the GOP

Dems: want a blue wave in ‚Äò18? 20? Then be Dems. Be the party you are, unapologetically and unflinchingly. Zero support for a regime that attacks rule of law, Patriotism, decency, compassion. Zero cooperation with a regime installed by an enemy. Isolate hate. No quarter...

SIREN: "Steve Bannon was certain that after the (July 2016 Trump Tower) meeting, Trump, Jr. had taken the participants to see his father," per excerpts from new Michael Wolff book, "Fire & Fury."
Trump has claimed he was unaware any meeting with Russians took place.
