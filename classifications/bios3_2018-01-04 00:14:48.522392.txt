Ivanka Trump, husband agreed she'd be the one to run for president, book says 
@CNNPolitics http://cnn.it/2AjaznT 

"Steve #Bannon has nothing to do with me or my Presidency. When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind."

Who lost their mind?

Coal mining deaths nearly double from 2016 to 2017

Might have something to do with all of those ‚Äúpesky‚Äù regulations Trump‚Äôs been removing. You know, the one‚Äôs that save people‚Äôs lives...

Fed up with the Trump admin? Me too. Angry that elected Repubs can't seem to find a spine among the group of them? I get that. We can change these things by holding these people responsible for their behavior.

We vote. #WeResist.

Replying to @PressSec @StephenMoore
The economy added:

2012: 2.2 million jobs
2013: 2.2 million jobs
2014: 2.6 million jobs
2015: 2.9 million jobs
2016: 2.5 million jobs
2017: 1.7 million jobs

See how Trump and conservatives LIE and say the economy was a disaster, now say it's booming.

News of the day: FBI‚Äôs Russia probe wasn‚Äôt prompted by the Dossier.

George Papadopolous got drunk & bragged to a diplomat saying Russian Gov‚Äôt had dirt on Clinton. That intel made it to the FBI. So the GOP‚Äôs been lying about the FBI opening the Russia probe based on the Dossier.

Trump‚Äôs spent over $120 million in taxpayer money this year on vacations. Time-wise he‚Äôs spent a third of his failed presidency on vacation, a third binge watching 24 hour news channels & drinking diet cokes, and a third destroying this country via Twitter & from just talking.

Everyone who retweets this agrees that any Republican Member of Congress who interferes with Mueller‚Äôs probe should be thrown out of Congress, and thrown into prison. Here‚Äôs a perfect example:

Trump fired every single member of his HIV/AIDS council without telling them why. Not only that, he did it in a letter sent via FedEx. He didn't even pick up the phone & call them. Laziest & most cruel president in the history of the United States-and obviously a complete coward.

We are learning right now why NEPOTISM laws exist. Why it isn't a good idea to bring your child, son-in-law etc into the West Wing. The result may be that #Melania & Barron are the only Trump's who don't go down w/ the ship. #Javanka #SteveBannon #FireAndFury #Bannon

@TNTDOC1 @BillHaslam what in the world is going on at Riverbend Prison?? 

No heat? Refusing to accept donated blankets? 

Sounds like cruel and unusual punishment to me. @Tennessean @WSMV @WKRN @NC5

These are just a few of the blankets that have been graciously donated for the prisoners at Riverbend. TDOC is refusing to accept them. I guess they plan to save money by letting insiders freeze.  @thisischurchtoo

I don‚Äôt appreciate being lied to @SpeakerRyan. Especially when it has to do with national security. You told the American public that Devin Nunes recused himself from the Russia probe & instead, he‚Äôs issuing subpoenas & canceling hearings. #RemoveNunes from the Intel Cmte NOW!

Trump‚Äôs attacked Obama, Hillary, NY Times, Kim Jong Un, talked about a wall he‚Äôs not gonna build and took credit for 2017 being the safest year for commercial airliners‚Äîsomething he had absolutely nothing to do with. All in the last 2 hours via Twitter. Trump‚Äôs crazier than ever.

DACA was established by Dems & the Obama administration in June 2012. Dems have always fought to protect all DREAMers.

Trump ended DACA in September 2017 because he hates & wants to deport all DREAMers.

No one is buying Trump‚Äôs BS. He‚Äôs a white supremacist through & through.

Rep Devin Nunes is a suspect in the Russia scandal, that‚Äôs why he recused himself in the first place. All he‚Äôs done is obstruct justice, interfere with Mueller‚Äôs probe, leak info to Trump & lie. He‚Äôs broken multiple laws & I hope the traitor spends the rest of his life in prison.

Biggest news of the day is the fact the Republican National Committee is being investigated by Mueller for conspiring with Trump, his campaign & Russia against the United States in order to interfere in our elections & undermine our democracy. They‚Äôre gonna need a bigger prison.

Whatever you do, don‚Äôt retweet this analysis I did of the Trump-Russia Dossier. It will ruin Trump‚Äôs day & make him absolutely furious.

On second thought, retweet the F out of it. The Dossier & Christopher Steele are more credible than Trump‚Äôll ever be.

At the end of Trump‚Äôs vacation he will have spent $120 million in taxpayer money on his travels. And since he‚Äôs staying at his own resorts, he‚Äôs actually making money off of those tax dollars. Most corrupt president ever.

Trump might have a point there. Don Jr. has coal black hair. Who else in the Trump family does? Somebody might want to check Ivana's mailman or gardener. Don Jr. about to get cracked like an egg.
